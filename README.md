# PixelCheck using Selenium

PixelCheck is a sample framework built using Selenium WebDriver for automated visual regression testing. It captures screenshots of web pages and compares them with baseline images to detect visual discrepancies. The framework helps ensure the visual consistency of web applications by performing pixel-based image comparisons during automated testing.

## Features

- **Screenshot Capture**: Takes screenshots of web pages and stores them in a specified directory.
- **Image Comparison**: Compares newly captured screenshots with baseline images to detect visual differences.
- **Customizable Baseline and Screenshot Directories**: Easily configurable directories for storing baseline and screenshot images.
- **Integration with Selenium WebDriver**: Uses Selenium WebDriver for web page interactions and capturing screenshots.
- **Extensive Reporting**: Logs detailed reports of tests and image comparison results, including diff images when discrepancies are detected.
